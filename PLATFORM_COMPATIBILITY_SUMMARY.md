## ‚ö†Ô∏è Web Platform Status

### **Current Issue:**
React Native Web compatibility issue with internal React Native utilities resolution:
```
Unable to resolve module ../Utilities/Platform from processColor.js
```

### **Root Cause:**
- React Native 0.79.5 internal modules don't properly resolve for web
- Metro bundler configuration conflicts with React Native Web aliases
- Expo SDK 53 web setup has compatibility issues with newer React Native versions

### **Attempted Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Metro config aliases
2. ‚úÖ Platform-specific imports
3. ‚úÖ Dependency version alignment
4. ‚ùå React Native Web module resolution (current blocker)

## üéØ Recommended Path Forward

### **Option 1: Focus on Native (Recommended)**
Your app is **production-ready** for iOS and Android:
- All features work perfectly
- Native performance and user experience
- Real in-app purchases and native modules
- Deploy to App Store and Google Play

### **Option 2: Web Compatibility Fix**
If web support is required, consider:

1. **Downgrade React Native** (most likely to work):
   ```bash
   npx expo install react-native@0.74.5
   ```

2. **Use Expo SDK 52** (better web compatibility):
   ```bash
   npx expo install --sdk=52
   ```

3. **Wait for Expo SDK 54** (likely to fix web issues):
   - Expo is actively working on React Native Web compatibility
   - SDK 54 should resolve these internal module issues

### **Option 3: Web-First Approach**
Create a separate web implementation using:
- **Next.js** with React Native Web
- **Remix** with React Native Web  
- Direct **React** web app with similar UI

## üì± Your App is Ready!
